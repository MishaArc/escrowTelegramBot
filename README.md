# Aiogram Escrow Bot

The Aiogram Escrow Bot is a specialized Telegram bot designed to facilitate secure, fast, and automated peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions without the need for a human intermediary. By leveraging the power of escrow services directly within the Telegram platform, this bot ensures that both buyers and sellers can engage in transactions with greater confidence and security.

## Bot Features

Our Aiogram Escrow Bot comes packed with features aimed at simplifying the transaction process for users:

- **Automated Escrow Transactions**: The bot manages the escrow process from start to finish, holding funds until both parties are satisfied with the transaction.
- **Support for Multiple Cryptocurrencies**: Engage in transactions using various cryptocurrencies, enhancing flexibility and choice for users.
- **Streamlined User Interactions**: Utilize inline keyboards for an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- **Real-time Updates**: Receive instant notifications about the status of your transactions, keeping you informed every step of the way.

## How It Works

### Starting a Transaction

To initiate a transaction, one party (the buyer or the seller) starts the bot with the `/start_deal` command. The bot then guides the user through the process of setting up the transaction, including specifying the transaction amount and the other party's Telegram username.

### Setting the Escrow

Once the initial setup is complete, the bot takes over the role of an escrow agent. For buyers, it will provide instructions on sending funds to the escrow account. For sellers, it notifies them that the transaction has begun and that funds will be held securely until the transaction conditions are met.

### Completing the Transaction

Upon confirmation of the funds received in escrow and the buyer's receipt of the goods or services, the bot facilitates the transfer of funds from the escrow account to the seller, completing the transaction. 

### Cancelling a Transaction

If a transaction needs to be canceled for any reason, users can employ the `/cancel_trade` command. The bot ensures that any funds in escrow are returned to the buyer, provided the transaction conditions allow for cancellation.

## Engaging with the Bot
