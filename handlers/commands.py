<b>Help & Commands</b>
Here's a list of commands and how to use them:

/start - Get started with the bot and see introductory information.

/help - Display this help message with detailed instructions and commands.

/new_deal - Start a new transaction. Use this command in a group chat where both parties are present. Follow the prompts to set up the deal.

/cancel_trade - Cancel an ongoing transaction. This command can be used if you need to abort the current deal for any reason.

/sent_wallet [wallet_address] - Submit your wallet address as part of the transaction process. Replace [wallet_address] with your actual wallet address.

/release_funds - Release funds from escrow once the transaction conditions are met. This ensures the seller receives the payment securely.

<b>Using the Bot</b>
1. To initiate a deal, use the /new_deal command in the group chat.
2. Follow the instructions provided by the bot to set up the deal.
3. Both parties will need to confirm the deal details for the transaction to proceed.
4. Use /sent_wallet to provide your cryptocurrency wallet address when prompted.
5. Once the deal is set, and conditions are met, use /release_funds to complete the transaction.

For support or more information, please reach out to the bot administrator or visit our FAQ section.

Remember: Always exercise caution when conducting transactions online. Verify the identity of the other party and ensure you are comfortable with the deal before proceeding.
